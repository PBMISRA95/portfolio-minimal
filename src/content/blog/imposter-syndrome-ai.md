Ever felt like everyone else is qualifiedâ€¦ except you?

Lately, I've been struggling with this thought - especially when reading job descriptions for AI and Machine Learning roles.

Even after building projects and learning consistently, there's this inner voice that whispers: **"You're still not enough."**

1. I have worked on a deep learning + computer vision project during my master's thesis.
2. Right now, I'm actively exploring LLMs, multi-agent systems, and building real-world applications.
3. I'm also re-learning Python more systematically â€” shifting from "GPT-assisted coding" to confidently writing code on my own.

But when I open job descriptions, they often feel overwhelming â€” like they expect a hybrid of 5 engineers rolled into one. It shakes my confidence and makes me second guess myself.

If you've ever felt like this, how did you manage it?

ðŸ‘‰Did you apply anyway, despite the doubts?</br>
ðŸ‘‰Did you shift your learning strategy?</br>
ðŸ‘‰Or find a way to redirect this thought itself?</br>

Would love to hear from anyone navigating this path â€” or those who've come out stronger on the other side.
