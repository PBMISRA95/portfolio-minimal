I thought tech skills would get me hired. Turns out, I needed sales skills too.

As a Machine Learning Engineer who is actively seeking opportunities since past some months, a steady realisation has been taking place on my side that **job hunting feels a lot like marketing** â€” but no one teaches you that.

## Why Do I Think That?

My assessment is that we are in a **transitory state between the new global order and the existing world order**, along with the ascending impact of Artificial Intelligence. Therefore, due to emerging technical, economic, and trade realities, the nature of business is changing, and the players are adapting to the change. 

This is thus resulting in a **very volatile job market**.

## The New Reality for Job Seekers

Therefore, this necessitates job seekers more than ever to also focus on the following:

ðŸ‘‰ **Pitching oneself**

ðŸ‘‰ **Building visibility**

ðŸ‘‰ **Positioning strengths**

ðŸ‘‰ **Selling one's story**

## Beyond Job Hunting

And in my view, this won't be limited to job seekers. Even in the workplace, the ability to **communicate value, earn trust, and build relationships** will gradually become as important as technical brilliance.

It's why I now believe **every engineer should study at least one book on sales or marketing**.

## The Bottom Line

Because in this market, **code doesn't speak for itself â€” you do**.

Have you felt this too?
