Tanks. Submarines. A 20-meter German E-Boat. 
And a lesson in how wars reshape economies.

One of the most interesting musuems I had ever visited until now is MM Park France, a hidden gem near Strasbourg — and easily one of the most mind-blowing WWII museums I've ever seen.

Spread across 7,000 square meters, it's more than a museum. It's a deep, immersive dive into the scale of wartime logistics, technology, and economic transformation.

Here's what blew my mind:

✅ 120+ military vehicles (yes, real tanks!)
✅ 500+ weapons and 300+ life-sized mannequins
✅ A reconstructed Kriegsmarine base featuring an actual E-Boat
✅ Rare details on Operation Sussex, an Allied covert mission in France

But it's not just about war tech.

It reveals the economic shockwaves of World War II — How entire industries flipped from civilian to military overnight. Shoemakers made boots for soldiers. Car factories became tank plants. It was an era of total economic mobilization.

For anyone into military history, wartime economics, or logistics, this museum is a must-visit.

But the my biggest takeway from this visit was - War isn't just fought on battlefields. It's also fought in factories, budgets, and supply chains.

Have you visited a place that completely reshaped how you view history or economics? Would love to hear your recs.
